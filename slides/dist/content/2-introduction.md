- Which one is better for my project?

---

## SystemJS

- Load dependencies in the browser
- Mimic HTTP2 (System.import)

## Webpack vs SystemJS

SystemJS strength => Load modules in the browser

Webpack strength => Creation of bundles in the server

## Webpack vs Gulp

- Apple vs Oranges
- Gulp is a task runner: copy, move, transpile, concatenate, uglify, etc.
- Gulp doesn’t resolve modules natively
- Gulp can be like Webpack but +code, +effort and +complex
- Webpack is extended by Plugins
- Gulp can be a complement to Webpack
