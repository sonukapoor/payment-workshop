## Authorization

- What is Authorization?
- The bank will hold a specific amount of funds from your CC. 
- No money is transfered.
- The funds are deducted from your credit card limit and can not be used. 
- The authorization gets cleared through a capture or after they fall off. 
- The bank decides how long a transaction can be hold for. 
- Front end developers will usually just do an authorization and provide the returned subscription / request ID to the next system.
