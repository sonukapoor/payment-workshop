## Settlement

- What is a Settlement?
- We are finally receiving the money, Yay :)
- Acquiring bank sends a batch of approved transactions to the payment processor. 
- Payment processor will contact the issuing bank to get the funds transfered. 
- Mostly happens at the end of day. 
- Takes 2-4 days before the money is actually transfered to the merchants account.
